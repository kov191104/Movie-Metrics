# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Metrics: Movie Prediction with Python & Machine Learning

**Movie Metrics** is a machine learning project designed to predict the success of movies using Python, based on various factors like genre, cast, director, budget, and release date. This project leverages Python libraries and machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and provide insights into movie performance, such as box office success or ratings.

## Project Overview
Movies are influenced by various factors that impact their success, like cast, budget, genre, and marketing strategies. Using machine learning, **PremierePredictor** aims to identify patterns and make predictions for:
- Box office revenue
- IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes rating
- Genre popularity and trends

The project is built with Python and uses popular machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares movie data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and creates relevant features, such as average star power, genre encoding, and time of release.
- **Multiple Models**: Supports various regression and classification models.
- **Prediction & Analysis**: Predicts movie success metrics and generates reports.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/PremierePredictor.git
    cd PremierePredictor
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the dataset** (see [Data Sources](#data-sources) for information)

## Data Sources
The project uses publicly available data on movies, including details such as:
- **Box Office Mojo** for revenue
- **IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes** for ratings
- **The Movie Database (TMDb)** for cast, crew, and metadata

Ensure compliance with the data providersâ€™ usage policies.

## Models Used
The following machine learning models are used to predict box office revenue and movie ratings:
- **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for revenue prediction.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: For handling high-dimensional data.
- **Gradient Boosting**: To capture non-linear relationships.
- **Neural Networks (optional)**: For complex feature interactions.

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**
   - Place the dataset files in the `data` directory.
   - Run data preprocessing scripts to clean and format the data.

2. **Train the Model**
    ```python
    python train.py --model random_forest
    ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**
    ```python
    python evaluate.py --model random_forest
    ```

4. **Predict Movie Success**
    ```python
    python predict.py --model random_forest --input sample_movie_data.csv
    ```
